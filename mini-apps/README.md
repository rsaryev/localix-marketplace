# Mini apps

The source of Localix's first-party mini apps. A mini app is Localix's own format, not a Claude Code
plugin: one `mini-app.json` (identity, category, backend, settings, commands), a `guide.md` the
agent reads with `MiniAppGuide` before it first uses the app, a native backend (`backend/`) and
screens (`ui/`). It holds no `skills/`, `.claude-plugin/` or hooks; see
[plugins and mini apps](https://github.com/rsaryev/localix/blob/main/docs/internals/plugins-and-mini-apps.md).

Localix ships none of them. A tag `v*` of this repository releases them as one catalog,
`mini-app-catalog.json` (`bun run pack`), which Localix trusts: they install from its Store (**Mini
apps**) like any other, and the store features and recommends the ones
[`catalog-picks.json`](catalog-picks.json) names. Its `suits` says what each app is for — file names
(`*.sql`, `compose.yaml`; `*` stands for any characters) and packages a project depends on (`pg`) —
and Localix recommends the app when one of them is open or in the project; a name there that is not
an app here fails the scripts' tests. Each app's guide for people using it is in its `docs/` folder;
[games](../docs/games.md) and the [recipes](../docs/recipes/) span several.

## Runtime model

Contributor references:

- [Database architecture](database/ARCHITECTURE.md) defines driver and workbench ownership.

A mini app's backend (`register(ctx)`) gives the agent tools over Localix's APIs and serves routes,
services, lifecycle hooks and channels. Its native workbench UI is built by the app into an
artifact; it may also contribute sandboxed HTML views, prompt sections, agent definitions, file
associations, settings, and commands with argument pickers. A guide too long for one read links
pages under `guide/`, which `MiniAppGuide` reads by name.

## Trust boundary

Native mini app code runs in the Localix API process. A third-party mini app must be explicitly
enabled before it runs. Declarative content still receives validation, path containment, size
limits, and surface-specific restrictions.

Sandboxed HTML views use an opaque-origin iframe and acquire a host-injected, offline
`acquireLocalixApi()` client over the versioned mini app UI message bridge. Native React workbench
UI runs in the host page, so like native backend code it loads for a third-party mini app only after
the user enabled it. A view can call only its owning native backend's explicitly declared
`uiActions`; the host binds mini app, project, session, view, user, and cwd context and brokers the
JSON request without granting iframe network access.

Mini app permissions do not form an operating-system sandbox. Review a mini app's manifest and
source before enabling code you do not trust.

## Contributor workflow

A mini app a person asks for is not one of these: the
[mini-app-authoring plugin](../plugins/mini-app-authoring/README.md) forks its
[template](../plugins/mini-app-authoring/template/) into the person's folder, builds and tests it
there, and installs it into Localix.

To add one here, create it with `mini-app create <name>` inside `mini-apps/`, then check it from the
repository root:

```bash
bun run check kanban       # mini-app check for one app: manifest, style, builds, types, tests
bun test mini-apps/kanban  # its tests alone
```

`bun run check` with no name checks the plugins and every mini app, as CI does. The
[mini app SDK](https://github.com/rsaryev/localix/blob/main/packages/mini-app-sdk/README.md) owns
the typed host contracts.
